//Temporary Background Alternative (Less Reliable)
If you don't want to use PM2:

>> nohup npm run dev &

for log
>> tail -f nohup.out

//To stop a process you started with:

>> nohup npm run dev &
✅ 1. Find the Process ID (PID)
>>ps aux | grep "npm run dev"

username  12345  0.5  ...  npm run dev
Here, 12345 is the PID of your Next.js app.

✅ 2. Kill the Process
>> kill 12345

If it doesn't stop, use:
>> kill -9 12345
✅ 3. Verify It's Stopped
Run:
>> ps aux | grep "npm run dev"
If nothing shows, it's successfully stopped.

✅ Alternative: Kill by Port
If you know it's running on port 3001, you can kill the process using:
>>lsof -i :3001
Example output:
node  12345 username  ...  TCP *:3001 (LISTEN)
Then:
>> kill 12345
